## Usage

```clj
(:require [schema.core :as schema]
          [pedestal.swagger.core :as swagger])
```


Annotate your endpoints using `swagger/defhandler`. This macro takes a documentation map that will be attached to the interceptor meta.

```clj
(swagger/defhandler my-endpoint
  {:summary "Enpoint for stuff"
   :description "This is an interesting endpoint"
   :parameters {:query {:param1 schema/Bool}
                :body {:param2 schema/Str
                       :param3 schema/Inst}}
   :responses {:default {:headers {:x-tracking schema/Uuid}}
               418 {:description "I'm sorry, I'm a teapot"}}}
  [request]
  ...)
```

You can use these interceptors just like any other interceptors in your route definition.

```clj
(defroutes routes [[["/my-endpoint" {:get my-endpoint}]]])
```

Documented paths are generated from your route table. You can inspect at any time what it looks like calling:

```clj
(pedestal.swagger.doc/doc-routes routes)
;; => {"/my-endpoint" {:get {...}}
       ...}
```

But what you normally want is to inject the documentation in your route table, so that is available to your interceptors. There's a handy macro for that:

```clj
(swagger/defroutes routes
  {:title "Swagger API"
   :description "Swagger + Pedestal api"}
  [[["/my-endpoint" {:get my-endpoint}]]])
```

The second argument to defroutes is an optional map that will be merged with the generated paths and some default values. The resulting swagger documentation will look like:

```clj
{:swagger "2.0"
 :info {:title "Swagger API"
        :description "Swagger + Pedestal api"
        :version "0.0.1"}
 :paths {"/my-endpoint" {...}}}
```

A special endpoint can be added to convert this data structure in a json schema and serve it on a path:

```clj
(swagger/defroutes routes
  [[["/my-endpoint" {:get my-endpoint}]
    ["/doc" {:get [(swagger/swagger-doc)]}]]])
```

And of course you can add a swagger-ui endpoint to provide an easy way to view and play with your API.

```clj
(swagger/defroutes routes
  [[["/my-endpoint" {:get my-endpoint}]
  ["/doc" {:get [(swagger/swagger-doc)]}]
  ["/ui/*resource" {:get [(swagger/swagger-ui)]}]]])
```

_Note that the swagger-ui endpoint requires a_ `*resource` _splat parameter._

All this would be a little uninteresting if we weren't able to leverage one of Pedestal's most interesting features: sharing logic between endpoints via interceptors.

A common pattern is to have an interceptor at the root of a path that loads a resource.

```clj
(swagger/defon-request load-thing-from-db
  {:parameters {:path {:id schema/Int}}
   :responses {404 {:description "Couldn't find the thing in the db"}}}
   [request]
    ...)

(swagger/defroutes routes
  [[["/thing/:id" ^:interceptors [load-thing-from-db]
      {:get do-get-thing}
      {:put do-update-thing}
      {:delete do-delete-thing}]]])
```
All the documentation specified in the interceptor (such as parameters, responses, description) will be inherited by the endpoints on the same path. Thus you can reuse both behaviour and the documentation for said behaviour.

And finally we want to be able to use the schemas in the documentation to check the incoming parameters or the outgoing responses. To do so we can include `swagger/coerce-parameters` and `swagger/validate-response` at the top of our route spec. The default behaviour of these interceptors could be overridden passing a custom coercion or validation function.

```clj
(swagger/defroutes routes
  [[["/" ^:interceptors [(swagger/coerce-params) (swagger/validate-response)]
      ["/thing/:id" ^:interceptors [load-thing-from-db]
        {:get do-get-thing}
        {:put do-update-thing}
        {:delete do-delete-thing}]]]])
```

For a complete example have a look at the `sample` project.
